# City-Schools-Analysis

**Introduction:** This analysis aims to uncover trends in school performance by combining simulated district-wide standardized test results for student math and reading scores with relevant school information. The simulated data has been generated to explore potential relationships between various factors and student achievement. Schools were categorized based on their per-student budget, size, and whether they were classified as charter or district schools, after which average math and reading scores for students were compared. The primary goal is to gain insights into the factors that influence student achievement.

**Key Findings:**  

- Higher school budgets did not necessarily lead to better test results; in fact, schools with budgets in the highest range of $645 - $680 per student performed worse than those with budgets in the lowest range of less than $585 per student.
- Smaller and medium-sized schools significantly outperformed larger schools in math proficiency, with passing rates of 89-91% compared to 67%.
- Charter schools consistently outperformed public district schools across various metrics. Further analysis is needed to determine whether this is due to school practices or the smaller student populations served by charter schools.
